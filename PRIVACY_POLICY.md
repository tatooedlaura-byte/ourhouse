# Privacy Policy for Ours Lists

**Last updated: January 20, 2026**

## Overview

Ours Lists ("the App") is a household management app that helps families organize grocery lists, chores, reminders, and projects. Your privacy is important to us, and this policy explains how we handle your data.

## Data Collection and Storage

### What We Store
The App stores the following data that you create:
- Grocery lists and items
- Chores and completion history
- Reminders
- Projects and tasks
- Household name and settings

### Where Data is Stored
All your data is stored in **Apple iCloud** using CloudKit. This means:
- Your data is stored securely in your personal iCloud account
- Data syncs automatically across your Apple devices
- Data can be shared with family members you invite through iCloud Sharing
- We (the developers) do not have access to your data

### Local Data
The App also stores some preferences locally on your device using standard iOS storage.

## Data Sharing

- **With Family Members**: You can choose to share your household data with family members using Apple's built-in iCloud Sharing feature
- **With Third Parties**: We do not share, sell, or transmit your data to any third parties
- **Analytics**: We do not collect analytics or usage data

## Notifications

The App can send local notifications to remind you about:
- Chores that are due
- Reminders on their scheduled dates
- Project tasks with due dates

These notifications are processed entirely on your device and are not sent to any external servers.

## Data Retention

Your data remains in your iCloud account until you delete it. You can:
- Delete individual items within the App
- Delete the entire household in Settings
- Remove the App, which removes local data (iCloud data remains in your account)

## Children's Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The App is designed for household use by families.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy in the App or on our support page.

## Contact Us

If you have questions about this privacy policy, please contact us at:

**Email**: [your-email@example.com]

## Your Rights

Since all data is stored in your iCloud account, you have full control over your data through Apple's standard iCloud management tools in iOS Settings.
