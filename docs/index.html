    <h1>Privacy Policy for Ours Lists</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: January 20, 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Ours Lists ("the App") is a household management app that helps families organize grocery lists, chores, reminders, and projects. Your privacy is important to us, and this policy explains how we handle your data.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection and Storage</h2>

    <h3>What We Store</h3>
    <p>The App stores the following data that you create:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Grocery lists and items</li>
        <li>Chores and completion history</li>
        <li>Reminders</li>
        <li>Projects and tasks</li>
        <li>Household name and settings</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Where Data is Stored</h3>
    <p>All your data is stored in <strong>Apple iCloud</strong> using CloudKit. This means:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your data is stored securely in your personal iCloud account</li>
        <li>Data syncs automatically across your Apple devices</li>
        <li>Data can be shared with family members you invite through iCloud Sharing</li>
        <li>We (the developers) do not have access to your data</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Local Data</h3>
    <p>The App also stores some preferences locally on your device using standard iOS storage.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>With Family Members:</strong> You can choose to share your household data with family members using Apple's built-in iCloud Sharing feature</li>
        <li><strong>With Third Parties:</strong> We do not share, sell, or transmit your data to any third parties</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> We do not collect analytics or usage data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Notifications</h2>
    <p>The App can send local notifications to remind you about:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Chores that are due</li>
        <li>Reminders on their scheduled dates</li>
        <li>Project tasks with due dates</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These notifications are processed entirely on your device and are not sent to any external servers.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Your data remains in your iCloud account until you delete it. You can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Delete individual items within the App</li>
        <li>Delete the entire household in Settings</li>
        <li>Remove the App, which removes local data (iCloud data remains in your account)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The App is designed for household use by families.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy, please contact us at:</p>
    <p><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:support@ourslists.app">support@ourslists.app</a></p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since all data is stored in your iCloud account, you have full control over your data through Apple's standard iCloud management tools in iOS Settings.</p>
